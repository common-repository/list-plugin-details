This tiny plugin lists selected plugin details which are provided on wordpress.org. It allows you to show a showcase of your developed or your preferred plugins, which are published on wordpress.org.

== Description ==
Whether you are a plugin developer or you want to show a list of several plugins. List Plugin Details retrieves details from wordpress.org like downloads, rating and number of reviews and shows them in cards. You will find a huge number of settings to transform the list into your list.
Add a shortcode on the page you want and enjoy the plugin list.

IMPORTANT NOTE: List Plugin Details is just providing the technical structure to show the retrieved details on your website. This plugin does not come with any style. So, it is important for you to add your own classes and/or to write some CSS to show your individual list. You have also the possibility to modify the showcase template and transform it to your needs.

= Why do you call dependencies from shields.io? =

List Plugin Details allows you to show badges from shields.io on your plugin page. This needs to get the badge directly from img.shields.io. You do not need to open an account. But make sure this is noted in your GDPR related information.
